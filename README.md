### What I learned

I learned about the picture element. I found it very useful for adding different image sizes to be used when resizing the browser.

<picture>
  <source srcset="" media="(max-width: 200px)" >
  <img src="" alt="" >
</picture>
      
### Continued development

I hope to continue working on creating more responsive websites and correctly naming the elements.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools Css Tutorials ](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - This helped me with creating responsive images. It also introduced me to the Picture elemene.
